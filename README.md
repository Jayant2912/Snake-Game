The Classic Snake Game created using the C programming language is a retro-style game that involves controlling a snake to eat food pellets and grow longer. The game is played on a rectangular grid, where the snake moves in four directions, and the objective is to collect as many food pellets as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

The game features a console-based user interface that displays the game board, score, and the snake's movement. The player controls the snake using arrow keys on the keyboard, and the game responds to the user input by updating the snake's position and checking for collisions with walls and food pellets.

In summary, the Classic Snake Game created using the C language is a fun and challenging retro-style game that provides an opportunity for programmers to practice their coding skills while also enjoying a classic arcade game experience.
